Thank you for buying Grid Controller!

We want your project to be a success! If you have any questions or feature requests, 
please contact us any time at support@pixelcrushers.com.


Getting Started:
----------------
o Play the scene in the Demo folder. 
  - The Demo scene was built for Unity's input manager.
    A popup window should ask if you want to automatically add the required input
    settings. If you don't see the popup due to other issues in your project, open
    the Demo scene, inspect GridController, and click the Grid Controller Input
    component's Check Input Settings button.
  - If you're using the Input System package or Rewired, see the simple setup
    instructions in GridControllerManual.pdf.
o Read GridControllerManual.pdf.
